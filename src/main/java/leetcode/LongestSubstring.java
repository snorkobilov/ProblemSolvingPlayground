     * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
         * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: s = "bbbbb"
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
     * Example 3:
     * <p>
     * Input: s = "pwwkew"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
     * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
     * Example 4:
     * <p>
     * Input: s = ""
     * Output: 0
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
     * s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
